GOGHTTPS

This is a set of rules informing the Firefox addon 'HTTPS Everywhere' how to rewrite GOG.com URLs.

Locate your Firefox/Iceweasel/Pale Moon profile directory, within which you should find HTTPSEverywhereUserRules
(provided you have the aforementioned add-on installed), place Gog.com.xml in there and restart the browser.
